# Homeworkone
For this project, we have reviewed our client's website and mainly updated the code to include semantic HTML tags. The goal behind doing so is to improve our client, Horiseon's search optimisation standing and accesibility, thereby improving its online reputation.

In this file, some of the changes made to improve and clean the code are: using semantic tags and alt image text.

The code used in this project is HTML and CSS.
